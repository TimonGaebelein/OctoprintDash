## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an issue, while using OctoDash please have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/UnchartedBull/OctoDash/wiki/Troubleshooting) first! If your issue is not covered please open an issue!

## Bugs and more

If you find a bug, please open an issue, so I can have a look at it. Please also add the steps to reproduce and the .gcode file. Thank you!

One more thing: If you're Octoprint is running on a Raspberry Pi 1 you may want to opt out of this because it just does not have enough power.
