If you can think of something nice to add or want to change some of the messy code feel free to create a Pull Request. I'll have a look at it and will merge it into master if everything checks out! Any help is greatly appreciated!

If you can think of a great feature, but don't feel yet ready to code something open an issue. I'll have a look at it and maybe implement it if I have the time. It is preferred if you directly create a Pull Request for your new feature. If you need some help, I can point you in the correct direction.
